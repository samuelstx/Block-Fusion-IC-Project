This is a small game for students to learn the operation and programming through instructions on a processor, in this case, the instructions of the intel 8086 emulated with a program called emu8086, used under the license that the University of Extremadura has for its educational use.

This game consists of a matrix in which values ​​that are powers of two are randomly established and through a series of commands we combine them to form the maximum value, which the user has entered as soon as the game starts. The game is considered won when the maximum value is reached and lost if values ​​are generated in the first row of the matrix, similar to what happens in games like Tetris.
